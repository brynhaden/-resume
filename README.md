## Skills

Attendance will be taken every class using the UNC Check-in App. You will need to install the UNC Check-in app to your mobile device and bring it to every class. Starting at the beginning of class, you will have 15 minutes to check-in using the mobile app. Instructions for installing and using the UNC Check-in App are available at <https://unccheckin.unc.edu/>. Go to this website to learn more. You need to attend at least 70% of the lectures to get credit for attendance, otherwise you will receive a 0 for your attendance grade. If you need to miss class for a reason permitted by the university and you don’t want to be penalized, you will need to get a university approved absence at <https://uaao.unc.edu/submit-a-request/>. If you cannot get a university approved absence and don’t want to be penalized, you must notify your instructor of the reason and provide documentation of the reason in email. The reason should line up with UNC’S definition of a university approved absence. For example, a job interview would not be approved by the university or me.

## Publications/Presentations

There will be at least one assignment designed to test proficiency in data science. This class involves group projects that require strong data science skills. These assignments will require you to perform data science tasks with data and must be done individually without the help of any other students in the course. The work required for these assignments will not be taught in the course but will come from material and topics taught in STOR 320 and/or STOR 455 and/or other provided material. These assignments will be submitted to either Canvas or Gradescope by the due date. You will receive a 25% penalty for less than one day late, 50% penalty for less than two days late, and 75% penalty for less than three days late. After three days, practice assignments will not be accepted. Expect these assignments early in the semester.
