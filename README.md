# **Fundamentals of Sports Analytics** {.tabset}

In this class, your performance will be graded using **six** different assessments: attendance (5%), practice (5%), gameday speeches (20%), regular season (20%), playoffs (20%), and championship (30%). For the gameday speeches, playoffs, and the championship, you will be randomly assigned to a team. This class is a team sport.

## Attendance

Attendance will be taken every class using the UNC Check-in App. You will need to install the UNC Check-in app to your mobile device and bring it to every class. Starting at the beginning of class, you will have 15 minutes to check-in using the mobile app. Instructions for installing and using the UNC Check-in App are available at <https://unccheckin.unc.edu/>. Go to this website to learn more. You need to attend at least 70% of the lectures to get credit for attendance, otherwise you will receive a 0 for your attendance grade. If you need to miss class for a reason permitted by the university and you don’t want to be penalized, you will need to get a university approved absence at <https://uaao.unc.edu/submit-a-request/>. If you cannot get a university approved absence and don’t want to be penalized, you must notify your instructor of the reason and provide documentation of the reason in email. The reason should line up with UNC’S definition of a university approved absence. For example, a job interview would not be approved by the university or me.

## Practice

There will be at least one assignment designed to test proficiency in data science. This class involves group projects that require strong data science skills. These assignments will require you to perform data science tasks with data and must be done individually without the help of any other students in the course. The work required for these assignments will not be taught in the course but will come from material and topics taught in STOR 320 and/or STOR 455 and/or other provided material. These assignments will be submitted to either Canvas or Gradescope by the due date. You will receive a 25% penalty for less than one day late, 50% penalty for less than two days late, and 75% penalty for less than three days late. After three days, practice assignments will not be accepted. Expect these assignments early in the semester.

## Gameday Speech

Gameday speeches are to be done in teams. Biweekly, your team will find a journal article from a refereed journal to read and summarize in an 8 slide gameday speech. You need to pick an article that none of the group members have read (previous gameday speech) and that hasn't already been presented in class.

- Slide 1: Title of the article, the names of the author(s), source of the article, and the name(s) of the presenters. If you have a team member who did not participate in reading the article or making the slides, **DO NOT** put their name on this slide. They will receive an automatic 0.

- Slide 2-3: Summarize the overarching themes of the article(s). Discuss the research goal(s) of the paper in at least 6 bullet points.

- Slide 4-6: Talk about the methodology. What did the author(s) do to answer their research goal? Discuss the methodology in at least 8 bullet points.

- Slide 7: What did you like? What did you find confusing? Provide three positive critiques of the paper. Focus on the methodology used in the article.

- Slide 8: What did you not like or think could have been improved? Give three negative critiques of the paper. Focus on the methodology used in the article.

On gameday, I will use a random number generator to pick 3 or 4 groups to present in 5 to 8 minutes. All groups will be graded based on the criteria, but only 3 groups will present.

The presentation should be submitted on Canvas before class starts on the due date. Each group should have their own presentation, but needs to be submitted by every member of the group as a **pdf**. Also, each group member can assess the contribution value of the other members of the team on a scale from 0 (Bad) to 3 (Excellent). Fill out the appropriate Google Form in the section below called **Team Sport** to turn in your ratings of your group members. Your value will be determined by the average score of the other members in your group. 

Gameday speeches are worth a total of 24 points with minor exceptions: 

- The 3 or 4 groups that present will have the chance to get 0 to 3 bonus points based on presentation quality.

- If your group presents and you are not present in class, you will receive a 3 point penalty and not get the bonus points awarded to your group for the presentation. 

Consider the following rubric and notice the bonus points for the lucky presenting groups:

| Criteria | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|:-----------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Slide 1|Missing All Components|Missing 2 Components|Missing 1 Component|Followed Directions|
|Slides 2-3|1-2 Bullet Points|2-3 Bullet Points|4-5 Bullet Points|At least 6 Bullet Points|
|Slides 4-6|1-3 Bullet Points|4-6 Bullet Points|5-7 Bullet Points|At least 8 Bullet Points|
|Slide 7|Missing All Three|Missing Two|Missing One|3 Positive Critiques|
|Slide 8|Missing All Three|Missing Two|Missing One|3 Negative Critiques|
|Spelling/Grammar|>5 Errors| 3-5 Errors|1-2 Errors|No Errors|
|Value|Bad|Okay|Good|Excellent|
|Submitted|Late||Not a PDF|On Time|
|Bonus (Presenting Groups)|Not Prepared|Prepared (Reading Slides)|Semi-Prepared (Mediocre Creativity)|Well-Prepared and Creative|

## Reg. Season

The regular season consists of biweekly quizzes on the material presented in class over the previous lectures. Coach Mario will tell you which specific material to study. This can include what was taught in lecture, what was in the reading, and what was presented during gameday speeches. You will be given at least 15 minutes to complete the quiz. These quizzes taken in Canvas on your laptop live in class. You can use the slides, notes, internet. The only thing I prohibit is the use of generative AI. You will also need a calculator, R, Python, etc. to perform some basic calculations to answer some questions.

## Playoff

<!-- The playoff will be a predictive modeling project for actual NBA games. The primary goal of this project is to design models for prediction of three variables -- $Spread$, $Total$, and $OREB$. Below you can find clear definitions of these three outcome variables:  --> 

<!-- - $Spread = \textrm{Home Points} - \textrm{Away Points}$ -->

<!-- - $Total = \textrm{Home Points} + \textrm{Away Points}$ -->

<!-- - $OREB = \textrm{Home OREB} + \textrm{Away OREB}$ -->

# **Team Sport**

Many of the assessments in this course will be done in a teams of 3 to 6 playas randomly chosen. For each team-based assignment, you will be given a different team. This will force you to interact with the majority of the class throughout the semester. After each team-based assignment, you will grade the contribution of your teammates on a scale from 0 to 3, and this will contribute to your overall grade for the given assignment. A decent portion of your final grade will be influenced by this. The following link contains all teams alphabetically: **[All Teams](Group Assignments/allTeams.csv)**

```{r,echo=F,results=TRUE,message=F}
library(DT)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
datatable(read_csv("Group Assignments/allTeams.csv"),class="display",options = list(scrollX=T, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-center', targets = 0:2)) ),rownames=F)
```


In the table below, you can find your group for each of the specific team-based assignments. Make sure you fill out the value survey before the time the assignment is due on the due date. Do not assess the value of yourself in the survey. You don't need to fill out the form if you are giving everyone in your group a perfect score.
